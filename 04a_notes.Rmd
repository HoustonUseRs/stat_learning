## notes

**following the example**
https://tgmstat.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/computing-and-visualizing-lda-in-r/

```{r}
require(MASS)


x1 = rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 10)
x2 = rnorm(100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
x =c(x1, x2)
y = c(rep(0, 100), rep(1, 100))

plot(density(x))


```


```{r}
# run LDA
r <- lda(formula = y ~ x, prior = c(1,1)/2)
r
```


## trying to predict

```{r}
predict(r, newdata = 10)
```
